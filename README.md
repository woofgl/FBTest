q: how to get access token

a: It's really easy with the Facebook Graph API. Sign in to Facebook and navigate to the Graph API Explorer app.
   (https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer) Click the "Get Access Token" button. That's it

   this way  is only useful for quick testing.
   For production use, you'll need to create a Facebook Application and use it to obtain OAuth tokens for your users
